# tree-sitter-luadoc

This crate provides a Luadoc grammar for the [tree-sitter][] parsing library. To
use this crate, add it to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`
file. (Note that you will probably also need to depend on the
[`tree-sitter`][tree-sitter crate] crate to use the parsed result in any useful
way.)

```toml
[dependencies]
tree-sitter = "~0.20.9"
tree-sitter-luadoc = "1.1.0"
```

Typically, you will use the [language][language func] function to add this
grammar to a tree-sitter [Parser][], and then use the parser to parse some code:

```rust
let code = r#"
@type Car|Ship|fun(type: string, data: any):void|table<string, string[]>|"one"|"two"
"#;
let mut parser = Parser::new();
parser.set_language(tree_sitter_luadoc::language()).expect("Error loading Luadoc grammar");
let parsed = parser.parse(code, None);
```

If you have any questions, please reach out to us in the [tree-sitter
discussions] page.
